Read thoroughly through the guidelines below. You may use the internet for help, however **any code that is not yours should be noted in your README.md**.

### Guidelines

- **YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ANY JAVASCRIPT FOR THIS PROJECT.**
- You can replace the cat images with whatever you want, as long as it's tasteful. Use good judgement. Placeholder images are fine. The current images came from [placekitten.com](http://www.placekitten.com)
- You can replace the page text with whatever you want, however keep the subject matter throughout the site self-consistent, and again keep it tasteful.
- Any links that would lead to external pages (e.g. social media sites) should just remain as either dead links (so, link to "#") or simply to the homepages of those sites (e.g. Facebook icon links to facebook.com). **There should be no other external links.**
- You don't have to use the same exact social media icons used here, but they should be the same brands and be of an appropriate size.
- The Contact form shouldn't actually submit data to anything. Instead, when the Submit button is hit, log the information in the form to the console.
- Use standard conventions for indenting nested tags and structuring your CSS. Keep it clean.

### Submitting Your Work

- You will create a GitHub repository for your work and submit the link to that repository
- You will deploy your site to a `gh-pages` branch.
- In the README of this repository, you'll include the link to the site that you've built. Use your README as an opportunity to document your submission, using markdown for basic formatting.
